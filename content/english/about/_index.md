What started as a small group of tinkerers and tech enthusiasts has grown into one of the most active and impactful clubs at Paschimanchal Campus. The **WRC Robotics Club** is more than a place to build robots â€” it's a space where ideas come alive, skills evolve, and students become creators.

### ðŸ‘£ Our Journey

We began with basic line-followers, curiosity, and limited tools. Today, we are a growing team building maze-solving bots, automation systems, and participating in national-level competitions. Our journey is driven by students who arenâ€™t afraid to explore, fail, and try again.

### ðŸ’¡ How We Think

We believe robotics isn't just about tech â€” it's about creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration. We value learning-by-doing, sharing knowledge openly, and building things that matter. Itâ€™s not about whoâ€™s best â€” itâ€™s about **whoâ€™s learning, improving, and helping others grow**.

### ðŸ”— Our Culture

Peer-to-peer mentorship
Open lab nights and weekend buildathons
Collaborating with other clubs, departments, and even startups
Making robotics accessible â€” no experience required to join

### ðŸ“Œ What's Ahead

As technology evolves, so will we. We're exploring AI in robotics, remote control systems, real-time monitoring dashboards, and IoT automation. The future is exciting â€” and we're building it, one line of code and one soldered wire at a time.
